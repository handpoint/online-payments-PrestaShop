# Contribution Guide

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and 
transparent as possible, whether it's submitting a fix or a new feature.


### We Develop with GitLab and Jira
We use GitLab to host code, Jira to track issues and feature requests,
all features/fixes are accepted as Merge requests.


**Great Merge Request** tend to have:

- Issue Number in Merge Request Title
- A quick summary and/or background
- What you expected would happen
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

ex. Mod-100-My-Great-Feature


### Releases

The repository could contain files that not always are needed by the end-user,
also sometimes a feature might need more Merge Requests to be completed, because of this, we use
`Releases` functionality inside Gitlab . Whenever a complete feature is done Developer/Maintainer
should create a `Release`.

**Great Release** tend to have:

- Meaningful Title
- `Tag` created according to semantic version (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning)
- List of added features/fixes added to `Release notes`
